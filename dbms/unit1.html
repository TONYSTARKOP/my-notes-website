            <h2 class="section-title">What is a DBMS?</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is a system that manages the creation, maintenance, and use of databases. It provides an interface for users to interact with the database and ensures that data is stored, retrieved, and modified in an efficient and organized manner. It also helps maintain data integrity, security, and consistency.</p>
                <p>In layman’s terms, think of DBMS as a <span class="important">library management system</span>:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Instead of books, it stores data in tables.</li>
                    <li>It organizes this data, making sure everything is categorized, easy to find, and not duplicated.</li>
                    <li>It’s like having a very smart librarian who knows exactly where every single piece of information is.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 class="section-title">Advantages of a DBMS</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><strong>Centralized Control:</strong> All the data is stored in one place (the database), and you access it through the DBMS, meaning everything is under one roof.
                        <div class="example-box">Example: In a small company, all employee details are in a single database, accessed through the HR system.</div>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Reduced Data Redundancy:</strong> Unlike file systems where the same data might be repeated in multiple places, DBMS ensures that data is stored only once. It links different pieces of data, rather than copying them.
                        <div class="example-box">Example: Instead of storing an employee's department in every record, the department is stored separately and linked to the employee record.</div>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Improved Security:</strong> Data can be securely accessed by only authorized users. The DBMS provides user authentication, permissions, and encryption.
                        <div class="example-box">Example: In a banking system, only authorized personnel can access customer financial data.</div>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Data Integrity and Consistency:</strong> The DBMS ensures that the data is accurate, valid, and consistent at all times by enforcing constraints like primary keys and foreign keys.
                        <div class="example-box">Example: An employee’s age must always be a valid number, and a customer ID must always be unique.</div>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Backup and Recovery:</strong> DBMS offers automatic backup and recovery mechanisms to ensure that data can be restored in case of failure.
                        <div class="example-box">Example: If a server crashes, the DBMS can restore the data to the last stable point.</div>
                    </li>

            <h2 class="section-title">Key Concepts in DBMS</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <h3 class="subsection-title">Data Model</h3>
                <p>A Data Model is a way of structuring data and defines how data is represented and manipulated within the DBMS. There are several types of data models, but the most common ones are:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><strong>Relational Model (RDBMS):</strong> Data is organized in tables (also called relations), and each table consists of rows (records) and columns (attributes).
                        <div class="example-box">Example: A Customers table with columns CustomerID, CustomerName, Contact, etc.</div>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Hierarchical Model:</strong> Data is represented in a tree-like structure where each record (node) has a parent-child relationship.
                        <div class="example-box">Example: A family tree model, where a "parent" record has "child" records, like in the old IMS DBMS.</div>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Network Model:</strong> Data is organized in a graph, where records (nodes) are connected by arcs (relationships).
                        <div class="example-box">Example: A social network, where users (nodes) are connected to each other (relationships).</div>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Object-Oriented Model:</strong> Data is represented as objects, similar to how data is structured in programming languages like Java or C++.
                        <div class="example-box">Example: A class Employee could represent employees, with attributes like EmployeeID, Name, Salary, and methods like calculateBonus().</div>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Schema and Instance</h3>
                <p>Schema is the structure of the database, defining the organization of data. Instance refers to the actual data stored in the database at a specific point in time.</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><strong>Schema:</strong> The schema of a SchoolDB might include tables like Students, Teachers, and Classes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Instance:</strong> If the Students table currently holds 100 student records, that’s the instance of the Students table.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Three-Schema Architecture</h3>
                <p>The Three-Schema Architecture is the DBMS’s way of abstracting data from the user to ensure data independence. It defines three levels of data interaction:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><strong>External Level (User View):</strong> The user's view of the data, which might differ depending on the user’s needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conceptual Level (Logical Level):</strong> Defines the logical structure of the database, describing data and relationships.</li>
                    <li><strong>Internal Level (Physical Level):</strong> Describes how data is physically stored on disk.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
