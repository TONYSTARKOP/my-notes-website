            <h3>What is a DBMS?</h3>
            <p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is a system that manages the creation, maintenance, and use of databases. It provides an interface for users to interact with the database and ensures that data is stored, retrieved, and modified in an efficient and organized manner. It also helps maintain data integrity, security, and consistency.</p>
            <p>In layman’s terms, think of DBMS as a library management system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Instead of books, it stores data in tables.</li>
                <li>It organizes this data, making sure everything is categorized, easy to find, and not duplicated.</li>
                <li>It’s like having a very smart librarian who knows exactly where every single piece of information is.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="dbms-advantages">
            <h3>Advantages of a DBMS</h3>
            <h4>Centralized Control</h4>
            <p>All the data is stored in one place (the database), and you access it through the DBMS, meaning everything is under one roof.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> In a small company, all employee details are in a single database, accessed through the HR system.</p>

            <h4>Reduced Data Redundancy</h4>
            <p>Unlike file systems where the same data might be repeated in multiple places, DBMS ensures that data is stored only once. It links different pieces of data, rather than copying them.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of storing an employee's department in every record, the department is stored separately and linked to the employee record.</p>

            <h4>Improved Security</h4>
            <p>Data can be securely accessed by only authorized users. The DBMS provides user authentication, permissions, and encryption.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> In a banking system, only authorized personnel can access customer financial data.</p>

            <h4>Data Integrity and Consistency</h4>
            <p>The DBMS ensures that the data is accurate, valid, and consistent at all times by enforcing constraints like primary keys and foreign keys.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> An employee’s age must always be a valid number, and a customer ID must always be unique.</p>

            <h4>Backup and Recovery</h4>
            <p>DBMS offers automatic backup and recovery mechanisms to ensure that data can be restored in case of failure.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a server crashes, the DBMS can restore the data to the last stable point.</p>

            <h3>Key Concepts in DBMS</h3>
            <h4>Data Model</h4>
            <p>A Data Model is a way of structuring data and defines how data is represented and manipulated within the DBMS. There are several types of data models, but the most common ones are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Relational Model (RDBMS):</strong> Data is organized in tables (relations), and each table consists of rows (records) and columns (attributes).</li>
                <li><strong>Hierarchical Model:</strong> Data is represented in a tree-like structure where each record has a parent-child relationship.</li>
                <li><strong>Network Model:</strong> Data is organized in a graph, where records are connected by arcs (relationships).</li>
                <li><strong>Object-Oriented Model:</strong> Data is represented as objects, similar to data structures in programming languages like Java or C++.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Schema and Instance</h4>
            <p><strong>Schema</strong> is the structure of the database. It defines the organization of data, such as the tables, columns, and relationships. <strong>Instance</strong> refers to the actual data stored in the database at a specific point in time.</p>

            <h4>Three-Schema Architecture</h4>
            <p>The Three-Schema Architecture is the DBMS’s way of abstracting data from the user to ensure data independence. It defines three levels of data interaction:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>External Level (User View):</strong> This is the user's view of the data, which may vary depending on user needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Conceptual Level (Logical Level):</strong> Defines the logical structure of the data, including all data and their relationships.</li>
                <li><strong>Internal Level (Physical Level):</strong> Describes how data is physically stored, such as the file systems or storage devices.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Subtopic Section 5: DBMS Architectures -->
        <section id="dbms-architecture">
            <h3>DBMS Environment and Architectures</h3>
            <h4>Centralized Architecture</h4>
            <p>All data is stored and managed on a single server. Clients access the data through this central server.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A small company’s payroll system, where all employee data is stored and managed by one central server.</p>

            <h4>Client-Server Architecture</h4>
            <p>The database is hosted on a server, and clients (users or applications) access the server via a network.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A university database system where the student or teacher accesses the system via a web interface, but the data is stored and processed on a server.</p>

        <!-- Subtopic Section 6: Classification of DBMS -->
        <section id="classification-dbms">
            <h3>Classification of DBMS</h3>
            <p>DBMS can be classified into four major categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Relational DBMS (RDBMS):</strong> Data is organized in tables with rows and columns. Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle DBMS, Microsoft SQL Server.</li>
                <li><strong>NoSQL DBMS:</strong> Designed for unstructured or semi-structured data. Common models include document stores, key-value pairs, and column stores. Example: MongoDB (Document-based), Cassandra (Column-family), Redis (Key-Value store).</li>
                <li><strong>Hierarchical DBMS:</strong> Organizes data in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships. Example: IBM IMS.</li>
                <li><strong>Network DBMS:</strong> Organizes data in a graph structure, where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships. Example: Integrated Data Store (IDS).</li>
            </ul>
