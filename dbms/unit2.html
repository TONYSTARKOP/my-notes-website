            <h2>What Is an Entity-Relationship Model?</h2>
            <p>
                The Entity-Relationship (ER) model is a high-level conceptual framework for designing a database. It uses entities (objects that are distinguishable in the domain) and relationships (associations between entities) to create a diagrammatic representation of the data's structure.
            </p>
            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Example:</strong> Imagine a library management system.
                <ul>
                    <li>Entities: Books, Authors, Patrons</li>
                    <li>Relationships: Writes (between Authors and Books), Borrows (between Patrons and Books)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="section2" class="section">
            <h2>Key Components of an ER Model</h2>
            <h3>Entities</h3>
            <p>An entity is any object or thing in the real world that has data stored about it.</p>
            <h4>Examples of Entities:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Employee: Attributes could be EmployeeID, Name, Department, etc.</li>
                <li>Course: Attributes could be CourseID, CourseName, Credits.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Attributes</h3>
            <p>An attribute is a property or characteristic of an entity.</p>
            <h4>Types of Attributes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple Attribute: Cannot be divided further. (e.g., Age, ID)</li>
                <li>Composite Attribute: Can be divided into smaller sub-parts. (e.g., Address = Street + City + ZipCode)</li>
                <li>Multi-valued Attribute: Can have multiple values. (e.g., PhoneNumbers)</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Example:</strong> For an Employee entity, attributes could include Name, ID, Date of Birth, etc.
            </div>

            <h3>Relationships</h3>
            <p>A relationship is an association between two or more entities.</p>
            <h4>Types of Relationships:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>One-to-One (1:1): Each entity in the relationship can be associated with at most one entity from the other side. (e.g., One employee can be assigned one desk.)</li>
                <li>One-to-Many (1:M): One entity is associated with multiple entities on the other side. (e.g., A manager can have many employees.)</li>
                <li>Many-to-Many (M:N): Multiple entities are associated with multiple entities on the other side. (e.g., Students enroll in many courses, and each course has many students.)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="section3" class="section">
            <h2>Advanced Relationship Types</h2>
            <h3>Recursive Relationships (Self-Referencing)</h3>
            <p>This occurs when an entity is related to itself.</p>
            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Example:</strong> An Employee may be a Manager for other Employees. In this case, the relationship between Employee and Employee itself is a recursive relationship.
            </div>

            <h3>Ternary Relationships</h3>
            <p>A ternary relationship involves three entities.</p>
            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Example:</strong> A Student might Enroll in a Course at a specific Semester. Here, three entities are involved: Student, Course, and Semester.
            </div>

            <h3>Weak Entities</h3>
            <p>A weak entity does not have a unique key on its own. It depends on a strong entity for its identification.</p>
            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Example:</strong> An OrderItem might depend on an Order to uniquely identify it.

            <h2>ER Diagram Creation: A Step-by-Step Process</h2>
            <h3>Step 1: Identify Entities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Book</li>
                <li>Author</li>
                <li>Patron</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Step 2: Define Relationships</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Writes (between Author and Book)</li>
                <li>Borrows (between Patron and Book)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Step 3: Define Attributes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Book: Title, ISBN, Year</li>
                <li>Author: Name, Birthdate</li>
                <li>Patron: Name, MembershipID</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Step 4: Draw the Diagram</h3>
            <p>Use rectangles to represent entities, diamonds for relationships, and ovals for attributes. Connect entities and relationships using lines.</p>

            <h2>Case Study: Library Management System</h2>
            <p>Hereâ€™s how the entities and relationships would look in a Library Management System ER diagram:</p>
            <h3>Entities:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Book</li>
                <li>Author</li>

                <li>Loan</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Relationships:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Writes (Author to Book)</li>
                <li>Borrows (Patron to Loan)</li>
                <li>Contains (Loan to Book)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A Patron borrows Books via a Loan.</p>
            <p>Authors write Books. Patrons can borrow multiple Books.</p>
